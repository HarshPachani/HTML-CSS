CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the Web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward.

-> A Grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a pattern against which we can line up out design elements. They help
us to create designs where elements don't jump around or change width as we move from page to page, providing greater consistency on our
website.

-> In short when we change the screen size the elements won't change according to the screen size increasing(won't expand), It will remain as it is.
