There are two properties that are required in order for the transition to take effect:
    1. transition-property
    2. transition-duration

Transition Shorthand
Each transition property can be defined individually, but for cleaner and faster code, it's recommanded that you use the transition shorthand.

Here's the full shorthand sequence.
div{
    transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay];
}

1. transition-property(required):
    The transition-property specifies the CSS property where the transition will be applied. You may apply a transition to an individual property
    (e.g., background-color or transform) or all properties in the rule-set(i.e., all).
    ex: div{
        transition-property: all; //Apply for all the properties
        transition-property: transform;
    }

2. transition-duration(required):
    The transition-duration property specifies the time span of the transition. You can specify in seconds or milliseconds.
    ex: div{
        transition-duration: 3s;
    }

Shorthand Example of transition-duration:
div{
    transition: all 3s;
}

3. transition-timing(optional):
    The transition-timing function property allows you to define the speed of the transition over the duration. The default timing is ease,
    which starts out slow, quickly speeds up, and then slows down at the end. 
    The other timing options are: linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out and ease-in-out.
    ex: div{
        transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
    }

Shorthand Example of transition-timing-function:
div{
    transition: all 3s ease-in-out;
}

4. transition-delay(optional):
    The transition-delay property allows you to specify when the transform will start. By default, the transition starts as soon as it is triggered
    (e.g., on mouse hover). However, if you want to transition to start after it is triggered you can use the transition delay property.

Shorthand Example of transition-delay:
    div{
        transition: all 3s 1s;
    }
